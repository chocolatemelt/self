        my first <em>__somewhat?__</em> completed digital painting. as a once-avid player of the
        game this character is from, <em>dragalia lost</em>, i found her character design to be
        particularly appealing, and painted this in a hurry after she received significant buffs. i
        admit i did take some creative liberty with her hair, however.

        i drew heavily on the painting style of{' '}

        . i tend to hyperfocus on the details, but this time i painted with fairly broad strokes,
        blocking out rough areas of light and shadow to make the piece more legible. as i'm still
        not comfortable working with color, i chose to work with a muted monochromatic palette,
        trending ever so slightly to lilac.
      </p>

        this was the last of three digital paintings i did in 2019, and the only one done on
        procreate.
